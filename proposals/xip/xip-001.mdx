summary: Establishing a standardized process for protocol upgrades
---

# Abstract

This proposal outlines a standardized mechanism for implementing protocol upgrades in the system.

## Background

Currently, protocol upgrades lack a standardized process, leading to inconsistent implementation and potential security risks.

## Specification

The upgrade mechanism consists of three main components:

1. Proposal Phase
2. Review Period
3. Implementation Phase

### Proposal Phase

During this phase, the following steps must be completed:

- Detailed specification document
- Technical implementation plan
- Security considerations
- Backward compatibility analysis

### Review Period

A minimum 30-day review period where:

- Community feedback is gathered
- Security audits are conducted
- Technical reviews are performed

### Implementation Phase

The actual upgrade process:

```solidity
contract UpgradeController {
    function initiateUpgrade() external {
        // Implementation details
    }
}
```

## Rationale

A standardized upgrade process ensures:

- Proper security review
- Community involvement
- Technical stability

## Implementation

Implementation will be phased over 3 months:

1. Month 1: Development
2. Month 2: Testing
3. Month 3: Deployment
