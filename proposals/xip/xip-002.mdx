# Enhanced Token Standard (XIP-002)

## Abstract

This proposal introduces an enhanced token standard that builds upon existing implementations while adding crucial features for improved interoperability, security, and extensibility. The new standard aims to address current limitations while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Background

Current token standards have served the ecosystem well but face several limitations:
- Limited metadata capabilities
- Insufficient standardization of security features
- Lack of built-in interoperability features
- Complex upgrade mechanisms

## Motivation

The ecosystem needs a more robust token standard that can:
1. Better support complex DeFi applications
2. Enhance security through standardized safety checks
3. Improve interoperability between different protocols
4. Simplify the upgrade process for token contracts

## Specification

### Core Features

#### 1. Enhanced Metadata Support
```solidity
interface IEnhancedMetadata {
    function tokenMetadata(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (bytes memory);
    function setTokenMetadata(uint256 tokenId, bytes calldata data) external;
}
```

#### 2. Security Extensions
```solidity
interface ISecurityExtensions {
    function pausable() external view returns (bool);
    function pause() external;
    function unpause() external;
    function blacklist(address account) external;
    function unblacklist(address account) external;
}
```

#### 3. Interoperability Layer
```solidity
interface IInteropLayer {
    function bridge(address targetChain, uint256 tokenId) external;
    function verify(bytes calldata proof) external view returns (bool);
}
```

### Implementation Requirements

1. **Metadata Storage**
   - Must support both on-chain and off-chain metadata
   - Required to implement IPFS fallback
   - Must maintain backward compatibility with ERC-721 metadata standard

2. **Security Features**
   - Mandatory implementation of pause mechanism
   - Required implementation of access control
   - Optional but recommended blacklisting capability

3. **Interoperability**
   - Must implement standard bridge interface
   - Required to support cross-chain message verification
   - Must maintain compatibility with existing bridge protocols

## Rationale

The design choices in this proposal are motivated by:
- Growing need for richer metadata in DeFi applications
- Increasing importance of standardized security features
- Rising demand for cross-chain interoperability
- Community feedback on existing standards

## Backwards Compatibility

This proposal maintains backward compatibility with existing token standards through:
- Inheritance of base interfaces
- Optional implementation of new features
- Compatibility layer for legacy systems

## Reference Implementation

A reference implementation is available at:
`github.com/protocol/enhanced-token-standard`

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**
   - Strict permission management
   - Role-based access control
   - Multi-signature requirements for critical functions

2. **Upgrade Safety**
   - Transparent upgrade mechanism
   - Mandatory timelock for upgrades
   - Emergency shutdown capabilities

3. **Cross-chain Security**
   - Verified bridge contracts
   - Proof validation requirements
   - Rate limiting on bridge operations

## Test Cases

Comprehensive test cases are provided in the reference implementation, covering:
- Basic functionality
- Security features
- Upgrade scenarios
- Cross-chain operations
- Edge cases and error conditions

## Timeline

1. **Phase 1** (Week 1-2)
   - Community feedback
   - Security audit
   - Documentation finalization

2. **Phase 2** (Week 3-4)
   - Reference implementation
   - Test suite development
   - Integration guides

3. **Phase 3** (Week 5-6)
   - Testnet deployment
   - Partner integrations
   - Mainnet preparation
